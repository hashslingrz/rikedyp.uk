# Learn Dyalog APL

### An introductory course with exercises

This course consists of a series of short videos, interleaved with problem sets. The basic notes from each video tutorial appear at the beginning of each problem set.

You will need access to [an APL interpreter](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Running_APL) and the ability to [type APL symbols](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typing_glyphs). Then you are ready to [Get Started](?p=1).
